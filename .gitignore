# binaries that are created during the install & build process

# git-modules (set them up yourself, see readme)

# ignore locally installed powershell-modules & scripts
scripts/powershell/Modules
scripts/powershell/Scripts
scripts/powershell/machines/*.*
# still load the local_machines'-scripts if available
# (you can have a script here, that autoloads, when named like your machine)
!scripts/powershell/machines/load_machine.ps1

# these two are individual & secret, put your own location-aliases and project-aliases here
