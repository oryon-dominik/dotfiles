Majorities, as such, afford no guarantees for justice. They are men of the same nature as minorities.

The state, therefore, is the most flagrant, the most cynical, and the most complete negation of humanity.

Since the birth of the state, the world of politics has always been and continues to be the stage for unlimited rascality and brigandage.

There is no horror, no cruelty, sacrilege, or perjury, no imposture, no infamous transaction, no cynical robbery, no bold plunder or shabby betrayal that has not been or is not daily being perpetrated by the representatives of the states, under no other pretext than those elastic words, so convenient and yet so terrible: "for reasons of state."

We are firmly convinced that the most imperfect republic is a thousand times better than the most enlightened monarchy.
		-- Mikhail Bakunin
%
In a republic, there are at least brief periods when the people, while continually exploited, is not oppressed; in the monarchies, oppression is constant.
		-- Mikhail Bakunin
%
While we prefer the republic, we must recognise and proclaim that whatever the form of government may be, so long as human society continues to be divided into different classes as a result of the hereditary inequality of occupations, of wealth, of education, and of rights, there will always be a class-restricted government and the inevitable exploitation of the majorities by the minorities.

The state is nothing but this domination and this exploitation, well regulated and systematised.

The liberty of man consists solely in this: that he obeys natural laws because he has himself recognized them as such, and not because they have been externally imposed upon him by any extrinsic will whatever, divine or human, collective or individual.

The great majority of people have to work in order to earn a livelihood, and a sizable proportion of them are productive workers. A huge number of workers are unproductive as well. They operate entirely with the circumstances and framework created by the capitalist system, such as shuffling invoices, contracts, credit slips, insurance policies, and so forth. Probably nine out of ten "workers" wouldn't have any work to do in a rational society -- one that would not require insurance or any other commercial transactions.

Collective responsibility in revolutionary action... is a fundamental principle, which guides each one of us in our way of understanding the anarchist idea, in our determination that it should penetrate to the masses, in its spirit of sacrifice.
		-- Nestor Makhno

It is through the inspiration of collective responsibility that the revolutionaries of all epochs and all schools have united their forces; it is upon this that they based their hope that their partial revolts -- revolts which opened the path for the oppressed -- were not in vain, that the exploited would understand their aspirations, would extract from them the applications suitable for the time and would use them to find new paths toward their emancipation.

Anarchism does not depend on theory or programs, which try to grasp man's life in its entirety. It is a teaching, which is based on real life, which outgrows all artificial limitations, which cannot be constricted by any system.

Anarchism is a part of human nature, communism its logical extension.

Liberalism, socialism and state communism are three branches of the same family, resorting to different approaches in order to exercise their power over man.

The power of the state will never deliver joy, happiness and fulfillment to any society.

I mean, "chaos" is a meaning of the word, but it's not a meaning that has any relevance to social thought. Anarchy as a social philosophy has never meant "chaos" -- in fact, anarchists have typically believed in a highly organized society, just one that's organized democratically from below.
