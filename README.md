## Requirements

explanation: "den" = cave, hive, nest, sanctuary..

## How to repository

...

you can follow the [tutorial on how to setup your own dotfiles here](tutorials/how-to_dotfiles.md)

...

work still in progress, just have a look around the script files

if you are interested in something special or you need an advice you may write me a message

this repos' main purpose is serving as a private dump - so no warranties at all for anything

the repository is mainly used with windows (&powershell), you will find some crumbs for linux-environments though

> especially all install-files are under heavy construction and therefore hidden from the repository
